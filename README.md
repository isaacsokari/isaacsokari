# Hey! 👋

## Welcome to my profile

As you've probably seen, I'm a web developer who's biased towards frontend, but open to some backend : work as well. 

When I'm not coding 💻, I'm probably playing Call of Duty Mobile 🎮, listening to music 🎵 or podcasts 🎙️, or even watching a movie 🎥. (Odds are, I'd be reading some article about tech or looking at documentation too but that's not all, I promise. 😄 :running_man:)

Feel free to check out my website - isaacsokari.com, and reachout to me if you'd like to collaborate.

Cheers! 👍
