# Hey! 👋

## Welcome to my profile!
<br>

As you've probably seen over there 👈, I'm a web developer who's biased towards the frontend, but open to some backend work if that's what the team needs. 

When I'm not coding 💻, I'd probably be playing some Call of Duty Mobile 🎮, listening to music 🎵 or podcasts 🎙️, or even watching a movie 🎥. (Odds are, I'd be reading some article about tech or looking at documentation too but that's not all I do, I promise. 😄 :running_man:)

Feel free to check out my website - [isaacsokari.com](https://isaacsokari.com), and reachout to me if you'd like to collaborate.

Cheers! 👍
